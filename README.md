*For the most up-to-date version of the README, please refer to the version on the master branch.*

COVID-19 dashboard is a web app (made with Spring Boot and Vaadin) that displays COVID-19 statistics on a global level 
and on a per-country basis. 

[See it running live](https://covid19.karankumar.com/). As this app is not mobile-ready yet, for the best experience, please view it on either a desktop or laptop.

*Note: the fetched data is cached for 24 hours.*

## Features

*Note: the screenshots above are for illustrative purposes only. The actual UI may look slightly different. 
If any major changes are made, new screenshots will be uploaded.*

### Global overview

![Global dashboard](/media/global_dashboard.png)

The global page has:
- Live counters for the total number of deaths, total number of people recovered and total number of confirmed cases worldwide
- A table with information for different metrics for each country that there is data for
- Pie charts to visualise which countries have had the most COVID-19 deaths and confirmed cases

### Change in cases over time for a specific country

![Country dashboard](/media/cases_and_deaths_one_country.png)

See how the number of deaths has changed over time, since the first COVID-19 death, as the number of confirmed cases
have changed over time (also since the first confirmed case).

### Case comparison between countries

![Case comparison](/media/cases_comparison.png)

Compare one country's rate of confirmed cases with others (the screenshot above shows a comparison with
one other country, but you can compare a country with multiple other countries).

### Death comparison between countries
